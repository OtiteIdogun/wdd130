      <p>Hello! My name is Otite Philemon Idogun, and I from Nigeria. I am currently studying at BYU-Idaho with a major in Software Development, and I am in my first year of study. </p>
      <p>I have always had a passion for technology, and this is one of the primary reasons I chose to study Software Development here at BYU-Idaho. </p> 
      <p>In addition to my studies, I enjoy playing video games, listening to music and love to learn about various topics. </p>
      <p>In the future, I hope to grow my skills, develop new abilities, and work on worthwhile software projects that can improve people's lives. </p>
